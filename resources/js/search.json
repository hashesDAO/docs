Each NFT has an associated hash (hence the name!) and is minted using a specific phrase or message that is provided by the owner when minting. In practice this means that the hash associated with each NFT is deterministically generated when minting occurs. Specifically, users can mint a Hashes NFT by providing a phrase of their choice that is then hashed along with a monotonically increasing nonce (tokenId) and the minter's Ethereum address using the Keccak-256 hash function. This results in generating a unique 32-byte hash value for the token."]},{"l":"Types and Functions","p":["The Hashes NFT acts as the leading NFT of the ecosystem, a pseudo-random source of entropy for digital art, and a coordination mechanism for governance and on-chain operations. The Hashes NFT collection is divided into three categories: DAO Hashes, Standard Hashes, and Deactivated DAO Hashes:","DAO Hashes are the governance tokens of the DAO, and holders of these NFTs have the right to participate in the decision-making processes of the organization. Principally, DAO NFT holders have the right to propose and vote on permutations, along with having shared ownership rights over the DAO's assets, namely the Permuation one Harvest NFTs and the DAO treasury. DAO NFT holders also have exclusive access to community discord servers where operations and community initatives are discussed.It might also interest readers to know that when the DAO was founded in late 2021 the first 100 DAO NFTs where reserved by Dex Labs, the primary founders of the DAO, with a subsequent 900 being made available to the public to mint for one Ether each. This was the initial capital raise of the DAO and a maximum of 1000 DAO hashes can exist.","DAO NFTs are distinguished from Standard NFTs with a fuzzy red border","Standard Hashes, on the other hand, do not convey governance rights and are primarily used as an entry point into the DAO allowing the community to expand organically. Standard Hashes are currently free to mint on Ethereum mainnet and can be used to mint Hashes collections, such as Sigils Genesis, or in order to recieve discounts on purchases from the Trash Bin.","Lastly, Deactivated Hashes are former DAO NFTs that have had their governance rights revoked voluntarily by holders, and they now operate identically to Standard NFTs in the Hashes DAO ecosystem. Deactivated DAO NFTs can be reactivated by holders who re-commit one Ether back to the DAO. At the time of writing there exist 15 Deactivated DAO NFTs, meaning that the DAO is governed by 985 DAO NFTs. The ability for DAO holders to deactivate their NFTs is currently unavailable."]}],[{"l":"Governance","p":["The Hashes DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governed by the global community of Hashes DAO NFT holders. The DAO has employed a paradigm of iterating through focused projects called \"Permutations\" to successively realise its vision of supporting generative art. At a high level, the governance process for a Permutation entails three phases: discussion, votes, and execution."]},{"l":"Discussion","p":["To begin with, any member of the Hashes DAO (i.e. a Hashes DAO NFT holder) can propose a Permutation to the community in the Hashes Discord, wherein a constructive discussion ensues regarding the appropriateness, goals, budget, and feasability of the project. During this ideation phase a rough plan for the Permutation is devised, a sponsor is elected (typically the original advoate of the Permuation), and often several community members commit to contribute given their expertise and skillsets."]},{"l":"Votes","p":["Following the formation of a plan, budget, and delegation of core contributors that will work on the Permuatation, two governance votes must be passed. The first is a Snapshot vote that acts to gauge the overal community sentiment and support for the Permutation. It is important to note that the results of the Snapshot vote are non-binding. A successful Snapshot vote does not imply that the subsequent on-chain governance vote will be similarly successful; however, an unsuccessful Snapshot vote strongly implies that the on-chain governance vote will fail, and as such the Permutation might need to be either reconsidered or abandoned.","In the event that the Snapshot vote is successful an on-chain governance proposal may then be initiated. Technically, the governance vote is made by calling the propose function on Hashes DAO smart contract, which is modelled after the Compound governance smart contract. The propose function allows for up to ten transactions to be queued and ultimately executed if the proposal is successful. For instance, a proposal may request moving treasury funds from the DAO to a multi-signature wallet for an artist grant, such as what occured under Permutation six.","In order to make an on-chain governance proposal the proposing wallet must possess at least ten DAO Hashes NFTs. DAO members may then vote on the proposal by calling the cast vote function either in support of or against the proposal. Once a proposal has been initiated there exists a voting window of 17280 blocks (approximately 2.4 days) within which the proposal may be voted on. It should also be noted that a quorum of 40 votes must be attained in order for the proposal to succeed.","Finally, after a successful on-chain vote has occured, two additional transactions must be made to first queue the proposed transactions, and to then subsequently execute them. Similarly to during the voting period, the proposed transactions will remain queued and be unable to be executed for 17280 blocks. This series of delays and voter thresholds exists so as to mitigate any risks of attack or exploitation. After the queued delay has passed anyone may execute the proposed transaction, and the on-chain governance process has been completed!"]},{"i":"to-summarise-the-on-chain-governance-process-is-as-follows","l":"To summarise, the on-chain governance process is as follows:","p":["An individual with 10 or more DAO NFTs calls the propose function on the Hashes DAO smart contract, proposing a series of on-chain transactions.","Hashes DAO NFT holders vote by calling the cast vote function either in support or against the proposal.","On-chain voting lasts for 17280 blocks (approximately 2.4 days), and a quorum of 40 votes is required to have the proposal be successful.","Anyone may then queue the succesfully proposed transactions, and wait another 17280 blocks for the delay period to elapse.","Finally, anyone may then execute the succesfully proposed transactions with a final on-chain transaction."]},{"l":"Execution","p":["After the on-chain governance process has been completed the Permutation begins in earnest, with DAO members beginning to work on the newly funded project. Leading the Permutation is the Sponsor, who has executive control over the day-to-day operations of the Permutation.

Alternatively, a Permutation may be focused on building generative art infrastructure, which can entail both on and off-chain functionality. All Permutations are proposed and voted on by the members of the DAO, and they should align with the overall ethos and mission of the collective.","During the proposal process of a Permuation, a sponsor (typically the initial proposer) is elected to ensure the successful operation and fulfillment of the Permuation. The sponsor acts as the project manager for the Permutation, and is empowered to make permutation-specific executive decisions on behalf of the DAO. In this way, the sponsor can resolve routine challenges and decisions without requiring active participation by a quorum of DAO members. For instance, a sponsor is empowered to delegate, monitor, and remunerate constributors to a Permutation.

Finally, the Sigil Management contract introduces a novel eligibility criteria for the set of all Sigil NFTs. The Sigil Genesis collection is so named because it is the first of several Sigil collections managed by the Sigil Management contract.

The JPEG Trash Bin resolves this problem of terminal illiquidity by placing a permanent and implicit bid on every NFT on Ethereum.","The JPEG Trash Bin allows anyone to sell their illiquid NFTs on Ethereum to a smart contract in exchange for a small amount of ETH. Furthermore, this dApp also provides users with a marketplace where collectors can “dumpster dive” for NFT gems that others have previously trashed.
