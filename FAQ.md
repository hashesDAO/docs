The Hashes NFT collection is divided into three categories: DAO Hashes, Standard Hashes, and Deactivated DAO Hashes.

### How can I obtain a DAO Hash?

### How can I obtain a Standard Hash?
Standard Hashes are currently free to [mint](https://thehashes.xyz/) on Ethereum mainnet, and can be used to mint Hashes collections or to receive discounts on purchases from the JPEG Trash Bin.

### Can a deactivated NFT be reactivated to a DAO NFT?
Yes! Deactivated DAO Hashes can be reactivated by holders who re-commit one Ether back to the DAO. This is achieved via an on-chain transaction to the `activateTokens` function on the [Hashes NFT contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd07e72b00431af84ad438ca995fd9a7f0207542d#code).

### How much was raised at the genesis of the DAO?

The current value of the treasury can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbd3af18e0b7ebb30d49b253ab00788b92604552c).

### What are Permutations in the Hashes DAO?
Permutations in the Hashes DAO are discrete and directed initiatives that the community funds and works together to undertake. They can include things like artist or developer grants, or building generative art infrastructure.

### Who can propose a Permutation to the Hashes DAO community?
Any member of the Hashes DAO can propose a Permutation to the community in the [Hashes Discord](https://discord.com/channels/895057713279676427/895391609586323457).

### Who is the sponsor in a Permutation?
A sponsor, typically the initial proposer, is elected during the proposal process to ensure the successful operation and fulfillment of the Permutation. The Sponsor acts as the project manager for the Permutation and is empowered to make Permutation-specific executive decisions on behalf of the DAO.

### What is the Snapshot vote and what does it do?
The Snapshot vote is a non-binding vote that acts to gauge the overal community sentiment and support for a Permutation.

### If a Snapshot vote is non-binding why do it at all?
A Snapshot vote is a means of gauging community support for a Permutation, and prevents unnecessary on-chain governance proposals that will be highly likely to fail. It is important to note that a succesful Snapshot vote does not imply that the subsequent on-chain governance vote will be simialrly successful; however, an unsuccessful Snapshot vote strongly implies that the on-chain governance vote will fail.

### What is an on-chain governance proposal and what does it do?
An on-chain governance proposal is the formal process that allows Hashes DAO NFT holders to vote on proposed actions or changes to the Hashes DAO smart contract. As an example, accessing the DAO's treasury assets to fund a Permutation requires an on-chain governance proposal.

### How many DAO NFTs are needed to make an on-chain governance proposal?
10 DAO NFTs.

### What is the quorum for an on-chain governance proposal?
40 votes.

### How long is the voting window for an on-chain governance proposal?
17280 blocks (approximately 2.4 days).

### Where can I find the Harvest NFTs?
Browse the full collection on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/0xf2928B732E533592501b0C73B4bDa8E8A5621604).

### What is the Collection Factory?
A Collection Factory is set of smart contracts that allows anyone to create a unique kind of ERC721 NFT collection, known as a Hashes collection. All Hashes collections are automatically integrated into the Hashes DAO ecosystem and website. 

### What is the benefit of creating a Hashes Colllection?
Hashes collections provide artists with a wide range of freedom concerning the supply, mint fee, royalty, mint eligibility, allow listing, revenue sharing, and source of metadata for their collections. Hashes collections have been built with composability and extensibility in mind, allowing creators to realise their artistic vision. 

### I'm not a developer, can I still use the Collection Factory?
Yes! A simple and intuitive [user interface](https://thehashes.xyz/collections/new) has been built that allows anyone to easily create a Hashes collection without having to write any code.

### Who should get involved with the Hashes?
Anyone! If you're passionate about NFTs and generative art, we strongly encourage you to contribute to the Hashes in any way that you can.
